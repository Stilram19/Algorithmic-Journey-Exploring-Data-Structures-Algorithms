(*) O(1) Constant time: when the number of steps is independent of the input
size.

(*) O(logN) logarithmic time: the base doesn't matter, the most popular base
in computer science is 2, but all logarithmic functions grow in the same manner.

(*) O(N): the most popular of all sets, the time function is linear

(*) O(N * logN): it is between O(N) and O(N^2)

(*) O(N ^ 2)

(*) O(2 ^ n)

(*) O(N!)
