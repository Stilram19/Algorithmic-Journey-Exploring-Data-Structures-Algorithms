(*) Time complexity is the study of how programs slows as data grows.

that's why all constants can be omitted safely since they do not
grow as data (or input) grows.

Product Rule: (omit constants in multiplication)

O(5 * n) ==> O(n)
O(n / 5) ==> O(n)
O(321) ==> O(1) constant time

Sum Rule: (keep the term that's bigger)

O(n^2 + n) ==> O(n^2)
O(n^5 + n + n^4 + 123) ==> O(n^5)

(*) Space Complexity in recursion:
    Space taken by the stack frames pushed into the runtime stack
    are also counted.
